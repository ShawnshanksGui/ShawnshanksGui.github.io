I am a 5th-year PhD student in Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Dan Li](https://nasp.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lidan.html). I am also collaborating closely with [Prof. Li Chen](https://li-ch.github.io/resume/) and [Dr. Kaihui Gao](https://gaokaihui.com/).
My research interests lie primarily in networked systems, with a focus on applying machine learning technologies to networking. Currently, I am focusing on building up simulators for LLM training sytems.
